# STAT 5243 Project 3 A/B Testing

Jinze Shi, Qiaoyang Lin, Nan Xiao, Yemin Wang, Sally Liu

This is an interactive data cleaning and feature engineering platform built with Python Shiny, primarily designed for conducting A/B testing experiments. The core objective of the experiment is to test the impact of prompt text color (e.g., red vs. black) on user behavior.

**üî¨ A/B Testing Objective:**  
We use the prompt color of the Note (e.g., red vs. black) as the experimental variable, randomly assigning users to two groups:

- Group A: Displays red prompt text (emphasized)
- Group B: Displays black prompt text (neutral)

**üéØ Measured Metrics:**

Each user session logs the following behavioral metrics via the logging system:

- `apply_fe_button_clicked_count`: Number of clicks to apply feature engineering
- `apply_fe_button_error_count`: Number of errors during clicks
- `revert_button_clicked_count`: Number of clicks to revert changes
- `download_button_clicked_count`: Number of clicks to download data
- `download_button_clicked_time`: Time of the first download button click
- `session_start_time`, `session_end_time`: The beggin and end time of the user session
- ...

Data is written to a local CSV file (`session_log.csv`) and can be sent to a log server via HTTP POST.

**üß© Functional Modules:**

- Data file upload and built-in data loading (supports CSV, Excel, JSON, RDS, etc.)
- Variable selection and data cleaning
- Missing value handling (convert to NA, mean/mode imputation, listwise deletion)
- Feature engineering operations (Normalization, One-hot encoding, Date Format conversion, Box-Cox transformation)
- Visualization (line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, correlation heatmaps)
- Logging system automatically records user behavior data for experiment evaluation

### üñ•Ô∏è Log Server

A lightweight log server built with Flask and deployed on Render, designed to receive and record user behavior data (e.g., click counts, session duration) from the frontend Shiny Web App, supporting A/B testing experiment analysis.


#### üåç Project Deployment

- Service Homepage: 
  [`https://stat5243-project3-1.onrender.com`](https://stat5243-project3-1.onrender.com)

- Log Upload Endpoint:  
  `POST https://stat5243-project3-1.onrender.com/log`

- Status Check Endpoint:
  `GET  https://stat5243-project3-1.onrender.com/status`


#### üîß Render Configuration Details
 
| Configuration Item    | Value                                   |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Type                  | Web Service                             |
| Build Command         | `pip install -r requirements.txt`       |
| Start Command         | `python server.py`                      |
| Port                  | Automatically bound to Flask's port 5000| 


#### üìÅ Data Storage Format

Logs are automatically saved in the `logs/` folder with daily date-based naming:

```bash
logs/session_log_20250418.csv
```

**Example fields**:

| user_id | group | session_start_time | ... | download_button_clicked_count |
|---------|-------|--------------------|-----|-------------------------------|
| abcd123 | black | 2024-04-18T10:00   | ... | 2                             |

### üí° Statistical Analysis

The cleaned and feature engineered dataset can be found in [ab_test_log_step3_cleaned.csv](ab_test_log_step3_cleaned.csv)

To analyze the logged data, run 
```bash
python ab_test_analysis.py
```

The analysis results and plots will be saved to `AB_Test_results/` folder.
